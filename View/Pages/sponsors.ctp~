    <p>SydPHP could not be the ongoing success and enjoyable event that it has grown to become today, without the ongoing generous support of our sponsors.</p>
    <p>It is though this support that we are able to deliver great quality talks, in a central venue in Sydney, with special events throughout the year.</p>
    
    <h3>Become a sponsor!</h3>
    <p>If you run a business, or work for a company that would like to gain more exposure in the Sydney, and Australia-wide PHP community, consider sponsoring Sydney's PHP user group. Its a great way to get to know developers, reach a new audience, and a superb way to give back to the PHP community.</p>
